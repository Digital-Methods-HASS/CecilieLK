### Get the GoT data:

Before we can make any form of analysis, we need to upload the GoT data set:

```{r get-document}
got_path <- here("data","got.pdf")
got_text <- pdf_text(got_path)
```

## Split lines:

The first thing we do is split the book pages into individual lines:

```{r split-lines}
got_df <- data.frame(got_text) %>% 
  mutate(text_full = str_split(got_text, pattern = '\n')) %>% 
  unnest(text_full) %>% 
  mutate(text_full = str_trim(text_full)) 

# Why '\\n' instead of '\n'? Because some symbols (e.g. \, *) need to be called literally with a starting \ to escape the regular expression. For example, \\a for a string actually contains \a. So the string that represents the regular expression '\n' is actually '\\n'.
# Although, this time round, it is working for me with \n alone. Wonders never cease.

# More information: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/regular-expressions.html

```

## Including Plots

From there we can then tokenize the split lines into individual words, using the following command:

```{r tokenize}
got_tokens <- got_df %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text_full)
got_tokens
```

### Remove stop words:

The next step is to remove the stop words. These are words which we might deem unimportant to our analysis. This could be fx. "and, or, from":

We will *remove* stop words using `tidyr::anti_join()`:
```{r stopwords}
got_stop <- got_tokens %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  select(-got_text)
```
```{r count-words2}
got_swc <- got_stop %>% 
  count(word) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
```

What if we want to get rid of all the numbers (non-text) in `got_stop`?
```{r skip-numbers}
# This code will filter out numbers by asking:
# If you convert to as.numeric, is it NA (meaning those words)?
# If it IS NA (is.na), then keep it (so all words are kept)
# Anything that is converted to a number is removed

got_no_numeric <- got_stop %>% 
  filter(is.na(as.numeric(word)))
```
```{r wordcloud-prep}
# There are almost 2000 unique words 
length(unique(got_no_numeric$word))

# We probably don't want to include them all in a word cloud. Let's filter to only include the top 100 most frequent?
got_top100 <- got_no_numeric %>% 
  count(word) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  head(100)
```
```{r wordcloud}
got_cloud <- ggplot(data = got_top100, aes(label = word)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud() +
  theme_minimal()

got_cloud
```
That's underwhelming. Let's customize it a bit:
```{r wordcloud-pro}
ggplot(data = got_top100, aes(label = word, size = n)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud_area(aes(color = n), shape = "diamond") +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 12) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = c("darkgreen","blue","red")) +
  theme_minimal()
```
In this analysis we will use two lexicons. The first is the 'afinn' lexicon:
```{r afinn}
get_sentiments(lexicon = "afinn")
# Note: may be prompted to download (yes)

# Let's look at the pretty positive words:
afinn_pos <- get_sentiments("afinn") %>% 
  filter(value %in% c(3,4,5))

# Do not look at negative words in class. 
afinn_pos
```
The second lexicon is 'bing':
```{r bing}
get_sentiments(lexicon = "bing")
```

The third lexicon is 'nrc':
```{r nrc}
get_sentiments(lexicon = "nrc")
```

sentiment analysis:

```{r bind-afinn}
got_afinn <- got_stop %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn"))
```
Let's find some counts (by sentiment ranking):
```{r count-afinn}
got_afinn_hist <- got_afinn %>% 
  count(value)

# Plot them: 
ggplot(data = got_afinn_hist, aes(x = value, y = n)) +
  geom_col()
```
```{r afinn-2}
# What are these '2' words?
got_afinn_minus_2 <- got_afinn %>% 
  filter(value == -2)
```


```{r afinn-2-more}
# Check the unique 2-score words:
unique(got_afinn_minus_2$word)

# Count & plot them
got_afinn_minus_2_n <- got_afinn_minus_2 %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(word = fct_reorder(factor(word), n))


ggplot(data = got_afinn_minus_2_n, aes(x = word, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()

# OK so what's the deal with confidence? And is it really "positive" in the emotion sense? 
```

Sentiment summarized:

```{r summarize-afinn}
got_summary <- got_afinn %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_score = mean(value),
    median_score = median(value)
  )
```

### NRC lexicon for sentiment analysis

We can use the NRC lexicon to start "binning" text by the feelings they're typically associated with. As above, we'll use inner_join() to combine the GoT non-stopword text with the nrc lexicon: 

```{r bind-bing}
got_nrc <- got_stop %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"))
```
Wait, won't that exclude some of the words in our text? YES! We should check which are excluded using `anti_join()`:

```{r check-exclusions}
got_exclude <- got_stop %>% 
  anti_join(get_sentiments("nrc"))

# View(got_exclude)

# Count to find the most excluded:
got_exclude_n <- got_exclude %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

head(got_exclude_n)
```

Now find some counts: 
```{r count-bing}
got_nrc_n <- got_nrc %>% 
  count(sentiment, sort = TRUE)

# And plot them:

ggplot(data = got_nrc_n, aes(x = sentiment, y = n)) +
  geom_col()
```

Or count by sentiment *and* word, then facet:
```{r count-nrc}
got_nrc_n5 <- got_nrc %>% 
  count(word,sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(sentiment) %>% 
  top_n(5) %>% 
  ungroup()

got_nrc_gg <- ggplot(data = got_nrc_n5, aes(x = reorder(word,n), y = n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Word", y = "count")

# Show it
got_nrc_gg

# Save it
ggsave(plot = got_nrc_gg, 
       here("figures","got_nrc_sentiment.png"), 
       height = 8, 
       width = 5)

```


Wait, so "confidence" is showing up in NRC lexicon as "fear"? Let's check:
```{r nrc-confidence}
conf <- get_sentiments(lexicon = "nrc") %>% 
  filter(word == "confidence")

# Yep, check it out:
conf
```

## Big picture takeaway

There are serious limitations of sentiment analysis using existing lexicons, and you should **think really hard** about your findings and if a lexicon makes sense for your study. Otherwise, word counts and exploration alone can be useful! 

## Your task

Taking this script as a point of departure, apply sentiment analysis on the Game of Thrones. You will find a pdf in the data folder. What are the most common meaningful words and what emotions do you expect will dominate this volume? Are there any terms that are similarly ambiguous to the 'confidence' above?
